00:00:01,046 --> 00:00:04,396
>> I've been asked to help
a team evaluate students

3
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:07,686
who are hard of hearing and deaf
to see they had vision loss.

4
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,956
And because one of the syndromes
that people maybe deaf or hard

5
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:15,776
of hearing due to Usher's
Syndrome comes with vision loss.

6
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:19,556
My colleagues and I went
to the school and we began

7
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:20,806
to evaluate the students.

8
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:25,426
And it became clear that one
student especially was having

9
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,616
visual difficulties.

10
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:31,466
When we did the vision
evaluation, basically we found

11
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,356
that this is where she saw.

12
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:36,916
This little area here and it
was pretty disturbing to find

13
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:40,766
out that she had actually been
kicked out of another school

14
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:44,676
because her friends
had kind of labeled her

15
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:47,396
and teachers had labeled
her of being paranoid

16
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,626
and accusing others and lying.

17
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:52,976
And what had happened
was in gym class,

18
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:55,386
she thought that people were
deliberately throwing balls

19
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:56,776
directly at her.

20
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,956
And she thought that her
friends were sneaking up on her

21
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:01,866
to deliberately surprise
and bother her.

22
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:06,726
And what nobody knew, sadly,
was that from her point

23
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:08,976
of view that's really
what happened.

24
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:13,816
And so it's really important
to be sure when we're looking

25
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:16,916
at some of the reasons why
children may behave a certain

26
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:21,236
way or have certain
social difficulties.

27
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:24,066
Let's look at the sensory
perspective of it to see

28
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,116
if there is something
else that might be going

29
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:28,186
on that would explain
it and then

30
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,096
that we can do something about.
