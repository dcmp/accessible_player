00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,066
(male decriber)
A young deaf-blind man
and his SSP

2
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:05,066
approach to a large metal sphere

3
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:08,132
mounted to a red and black
brick plaza.

4
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:11,265
A building and trees are visible
in the background

5
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:15,600
and also in the reflection
of the sphere's near-surface.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,867
They begin discussing
the interactive sculpture

7
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,967
which is located
on the college campus.

8
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:23,299
The man has his
right hand extended

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,300
feeling the surface
of the sphere

10
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:29,599
As a third man wanders up
to the sculpture,

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,133
the SSP says to the first man:
there's a plunger

12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,967
when you press it,
it rings a bell.

13
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,967
He then rings the bell

14
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:40,567
and asks him if he is surprised
by its reverberation.

15
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,500
They continue to discuss
the installation

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,734
using tactile communication,

17
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:49,000
the specifics
of the conversation
is unclear.

18
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,800
Two ladies approach the sphere.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,500
One loudly slaps it
with the palm of her hand

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,533
as she walks around it.

21
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,867
The plunger
located about waist high

22
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,934
for an adult

23
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:05,667
is being pressed repeatedly
continually ringing the bell.

24
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:08,400
The SSP describes
the sound of the bell

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,266
while the young man
feels for the vibrations.

26
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,600
After ringing the bell
several times,

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,934
he reaches up
trying to determine

28
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:19,100
where the top of the sphere is.

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,265
He asks if it's possible
to climb on top
of the sculpture.

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,233
The SSP replies
that its over six foot tall.

31
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,300
He wonders how tall the SSP is,

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,600
and receives the answer:
six foot three inches.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,734
He then asks what it is made up
and the SSP replies with:

34
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:38,899
metal or possibly another alloy.

35
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,700
There's an identical plunger
on the opposite side

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,367
he then goes on to explain
that this sculpture
is reflective

37
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:49,533
and that he can see himself
in it.

38
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:54,433
As the man presses
the plunger again,

39
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:57,066
a lady's laugh is heard.

40
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:00,066
They continue talking about
the installation.

41
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:02,066
The SSP asks the man

42
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:04,066
what he thinks
about the sculpture

43
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,066
but his response cannot be seen.

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,600
Using his right hand
he tries to determine

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,233
the shape and dimensions
of the sculpture.

46
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:18,100
He asks the SSP
if it's a globe.

47
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,100
The SSP invites him
to walk around the sculpture.

48
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,100
A camera flash can be seen

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,799
in the reflective surface
of the sphere.

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,367
With his right hand patting
the surface of the globe

51
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:32,399
he follows the SSP slowly around
to the opposite side

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
where a second plunger is found.

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
The young man presses
the plunger

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
and is told by the SSP

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,867
that additional force
creates a lot of ring.

56
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,299
He peers closely
at this reflection

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,166
before tapping the sphere
with his hand.

58
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,767
Other people who are also
examining the sculpture

59
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:53,066
are visible in the background.

60
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:55,400
The young man continues
to tap the sphere

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,233
and peer closely
into it's reflective surface.

62
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,300
The man continue to talk,

63
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,300
the conversation
at this point is unclear.

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,300
The SSP then begins to describe

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
the shape and size
of the plunger.

66
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,400
He explains that the plunger
is circular

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,166
and it's about the size
of a man hand.

68
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,233
It is connected
to a thin metal rod

69
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,700
running into the middle
of the sphere.

70
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,299
The man uses his foot to feel
for the base of the sculpture.

71
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,533
He asks if it is possible
to push on the sphere

72
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,600
in cause it to rollaway.

73
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,867
The SSP jokingly replies
that if he wishes
to take the risk,

74
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:43,867
he can try.

75
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:47,867
He then shows the man
that if you push on it,
it will not move.

76
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,367
Do you want to try to push it?
look, I'm pushing it.

77
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:59,367
I can't do it,
it's mounted to something,
it's attached.

78
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, I wonder if I could sit
on the top?

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,300
Would you like me
to lift you up there?

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,367
I could lift you up
if you want.

81
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,367
Will it break?

82
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,433
No, and I don't think
I could really
lift you up there

83
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:14,233
But you can try to touch
the top if you jump.

84
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,834
Look, this is as far
as I can touch.

85
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,533
You know,
I can't touch the top.

86
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,867
He tries to jump
to the top again.

87
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,867
I can lift you up.

88
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,767
Uh, but what if I fall?

89
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:34,266
Well that's true,
it's too tall.

90
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,600
The video ends abruptly.

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
